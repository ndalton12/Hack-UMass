# Pocket Yoda
Project for Hack UMass V. Starts 12am Nov. 4.
A program where Yoda tells you about any object you take a picture of, inspired by YodaSpeak API.

# How it works
1. Clarifai API recognizes objects in pictures taken
2. Recognized objects are tokenized and put through OxfordDictionary API to generate relevant sentences
3. Sentences are converted into Yoda speech through YodaSpeak API
4. Text to speech built into Android reads it aloud to user
